Computer Systems

![img13](./image/NTHU_OS/img13.PNG)

<h3 id="1.1.1">Mainframe Systems</h3>

> Batch
> Multi-programming
> Time-sharing

One of the earliest computers

Evolution:

- Batch -> Multi-programming -> Time-sharing

Still exists in today's world

- For *critical application* with better **reliability** & **security**
- Bulk data processing
- Widely used in hospital, banks....

**Mainframe - Batch Systems**

- 透過一堆打洞的卡片程序，插入系統中來執行程式
- 一次只能執行一個程序
- Memory layout只分為 operating system 與 user program area

    ![img02](./image/NTHU_OS/img02.PNG)

- Drawbacks:
  - *One job at a time*
  - *No interaction* between users and jobs
  - *CPU is often idle*
    - I/O speed << CPU speed (at least 1:1000)

- OS doesn't need to make any decision

**Mainframe - Multi-programming System**

- *Overlaps the I/O and computation of jobs*
  - Keeps both CPU and I/O devices working at higher rates
- *Spooling* (Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line)
  - *I/O is done with no CPU intervention*
  - CPU just needs to *notified* when I/O is done
- 可透過 interrupt 的機制達成Spooling

    ![img03](./image/NTHU_OS/img03.PNG)

- OS task：
  - *Memory management* - the system must allocate the memory to several jobs
  - *CPU scheduling* - the system must choose among several jobs ready to run
  - *I/O system* - I/O routine supplied by the system, allocation of devices

**Mainframe - Time-sharing System**

- An *interactive* system provides direct communication between the users and the system
  - CPU switches among jobs so frequently that users may interact with programs
  - Users can see results immediately (response time < 1s)
  - Usually, keyboard/screen are used
- *Multiple users* can share the computer simultaneously
- Switch job when
  - finish
  - waiting I/O
  - *a short period of time*

- OS task：
  - *Virtual Memory*(簡單說把disk當作memory來用) - jobs swap in and out of memory to obtain reasonable response time
  - *File System* and *Disk Management* - manage files and disk storage for user data
  - *Process synchronization* and *deadlock* - support concurrent execution of programs

![img04](./image/NTHU_OS/img04.PNG)

<h3 id="1.1.2">Computer-system Architecture</h3>
 
> Desktop Systems: single processor
> Parallel Systems: tightly coupled
> Distributed Systems: loosely coupled

**Desktop Systems - Personal Computers**

- Personal Computers(PC) - computer system dedicated to a *single user*
- User *convenuence* and *responsiveness* - GUI
- I/O devices - keyboards, *mice*, screens, printers
- Several different tupes of operating systems
  - Windows, MacOS, Unix, Linux
- Lack of file and OS protection from users
  - Worm, Virus

**Parallel Systems**

- a.k.a. *Multiprocessor* or *tightly coupled system*
  - More than one CPU/core in close communication
  - Usually communicate through *shared memory*
- Purposes：
  - Throughpu, Economical, Reliability

    ![img05](./image/NTHU_OS/img05.PNG)

Symmetric Multiprocessor System (SMP)

- Each processor runs the same OS
- Most popular multiple-processor architecture
- Require *extensive synchronization* to protect data integrity

Asymmetric Multiprocessor System (AMP)

- Each processor is assigned a specific task
- One Master CPU & multiple slave CPUs
- More common in extremely large systems

Multi-Core Processor

![img06](./image/NTHU_OS/img06.PNG)

Many-Core Processor

![img07](./image/NTHU_OS/img07.PNG)

Memory Access Architecture

![img08](./image/NTHU_OS/img08.PNG)

**Distributed Systems**

- A.K.A. *loosely coupled system*
  - Each processor has its own local memory
  - Processors communicate with one another thrrough various communication lines (I/O bus or network)
  - Easy to *scale to large number of nodes* (hundreds of thousands, e.g. Internet)

- Purpose
  - Resource sharing
  - Load sharing
  - Reliabilit

- Architecture: 
  - *client-server*： FTP......

    ![img09](./image/NTHU_OS/img09.PNG)

  - *peer-to-peer*

    ![img10](./image/NTHU_OS/img10.PNG)

Clustered Systems

- Definition: 
  - Cluster computers *share storage* and are closely *linked via a local area network(LAN)* or a *faster interconnect*, such as InfiniBand(up to 300Gb/s)
- *Asymmetric clustering*: one server runs the application while other servers standby
- *Symmetric clustering*: two or more hosts are running application and are monitoring each other

System Architecture Summary

![img11](./image/NTHU_OS/img11.PNG)

<h3 id="1.1.3">Special-purpose Systems</h3>

> Real-Time Systems
> Multimedia Systems
> Handheld Sysytems

**Real-Time Operation Systems (RTOS)**

- Well-defined *fixed-time constraints*
  - `Real-time` doesn't mean speed, but *keeping deadline*
- Guaranteed response and reaction times
- Often used as a control device in a dedicated application:
  - Scientific experiments, medical imaging systems, industrial control systems, weapon systems, etc
- Real-time requirement: *hard* or *soft*

    ![img12](./image/NTHU_OS/img12.PNG)

**Multimedia Systems**

- A wide range of applications including audio and video files(e.g. ppstream, online TV)
- Issues:
  - *Timing constraints*: 24~30 frames per second
  - *On-demand/live streaming*: media file is only played but not stored
  - *Compression*: due to the size and rate of multimedia systems

**Handheld/Embedded Systems**

- Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs)
- Cellular telephones
- *HW specialized OS*
- Issues:
  - Limited memory
  - Slow processors
  - Battery consumption
  - Small display screens

<h3 id="1.2.1">What is an Operating System</h3>

Four components in Computer System： Hardware, OS, Application, User

![img14](./image/NTHU_OS/img14.PNG)

![img15](./image/NTHU_OS/img15.PNG)

What is an Operating System?

- An operating system is the `"permanent"` software that *controls/abstracts hardware resources* for user application

    ![img16](./image/NTHU_OS/img16.PNG)

Multi-tasking Operating Systems

- Manages resources and processes to support different user applications
- Provides Applications Programming Interface (API) for user applications

    ![img17](./image/NTHU_OS/img17.PNG)

General-Purpose Operating Systems

![img18](./image/NTHU_OS/img18.PNG)

Definition of an Operating System

- **Resource allocator** - *manages* and *allocates resources* to insure efficiency and fairness
- **Control program** - *controls* the execution of *user programs* and operations of *I/O devices* to prevent errors and improper use of computer
- **Kernel**(會作為作業系統的別名，核心) - the one program running at all times (all else being system/application programs)

Goals of an Operating System

- **Convenience**
  - make computer system easy to use and compute
  - In particular for small PC
- **Efficiency**
  - use computer hardware in an efficient manner
  - Especially for large, shared, multiuser systems

    --> Two goals are sometimes *contradictory*
    --> In the past, efficiency is more important

Importance of an Operating System

- System API are the *only* interface between user application and hardware
  - API are designed for general-purpose, not performance driven
- OS code cannot allow any bug
  - Any break (e.g. invalid access) cause reboot
- The owner of OS technology *controls* the software & hardware industry
- Operating systems and computer architecture influence each other

Modern Operating Systems

![img19](./image/NTHU_OS/img19.PNG)

<h3 id="1.2.2">Computer-System Organization</h3>

- One or more CPUs, device controllers connect through *common bus* providing access to *shared memory*

- Goal： *Concurrent* execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles

    ![img20](./image/NTHU_OS/img20.PNG)

Computer-System Operations

- Each device controller is in charge of a particular device type
- Each device controller has a local buffer. 
    --> I/O device 運作相對於CPU太慢，若沒有buffer，CPU會一直在idle
    --> Status reg: 設置相關設定
    --> Data reg: 先儲存資料，再放入buffer
- *I/O is from the device to controller's local buffer*
- *CPU moves data* from/to *memory* to/from *local buffers* in device controllers
- Device 與 Memory 之間會有一個 Device Controller 作為傳輸的橋樑，Device Controller的好壞會影響到I/O的速度，CPU會下指令操作Device Controller的register，進而操作到Device

    ![img21](./image/NTHU_OS/img21.PNG)

---

Busy/wait output

- Simplest way to program device
  - Use instruction to test when device is ready
  - 每次寫入都去 `peek` 寫入字元動作是否已完成再繼續寫下一個字元
  - 此方式來讀寫I/O device會造成一直霸佔CPU，無法實現 "Overlaps the I/O and computation of jobs"，因此要使用 `interrupt I/O` 的方式

    ![img22](./image/NTHU_OS/img22.PNG)

Interrupt I/O

- Busy/wait is very inefficient
  - CPU can't do other work while testing device
  - Hard to do simultaneous I/O
- *Interrupts* allow a device to *change the flow of control in the CPU*
  - Causes subroutine call to handle device

Interrupt I/O Timeline

- Interrupt time line for I/O on a single process
  - `CPU = high`：CPU原本在處理目前的 user process executing
  - `I/O device = high`：idle
  - I/O device拉low，傳遞資料到buffer中，完成後會拉high，進而對CPU產生中斷

    ![img23](./image/NTHU_OS/img23.PNG)

Interrupt-Driven I/O

- 初始化I/O後，當Controller準備好時會發出interrupt，CPU才需處理相關事務，處理完後CPU會再返回目前行程
- 軟體的interrupt通常為主動產生，而硬體的interrupt為被動產生 

    ![img24](./image/NTHU_OS/img24.PNG)

Interrupt

- *Modern OS are interrupt driven*
- The occurrence of an event is signaled by an interrupt from either hardwrae or software
  - *Hardware* may trigger an interrupt at any time by sending a *signal* to CPU
    - signal是專門用於硬體中斷使用的詞語
  - *Software* may trigger an interrupt either by 
    - an *error*(division by zero or invalid memory access) --> 非預期(被動?)
    - or by a user request for an *operating system service* (*system call*) --> 預期的(主動?)
    - Software interrupt also called *trap*

HW Interrupt

- CPU原先在執行 user program，但hardware device被觸發產生一個interrupt signal(CPU被動被中斷)
- 接著CPU會去 `interrupt vector` 中搜索該signal相對應(硬體設計出來的，某個硬體插到某個Port，會有對應的signal number(由硬體設計固定的))的function pointer
- function pointer會引導到所要執行的function code去作處理
- 執行對應siganl的function code又稱為 `Service Routine`
- OS執行完後會返回CPU原先執行的 user program

    ![img25](./image/NTHU_OS/img25.PNG)

SW Interrupt

- CPU原先在執行某一個program，主動產生一個 `system call` 來中斷CPU
- 由於SW Interrupt的數量是unbounded的，不採用和HW Interrupt一個由interrup vector來處理，而是使用 `switch case` 的方式來設計，流程上與HW Interrup是相似的，只是實現方式不同

    ![img26](./image/NTHU_OS/img26.PNG)

Common Functions of Interrupts

- Interrupt transfers control to the interrupt service routine generally, through the *interrupt vector*, which contains the *addresses* (function pointer) of all the *service (i.e. interrupt handler) routunes*
- Interrupt architecture must save the *address* of the *interrupted instruction*
- Incoming interrupts are *disabled* while another interrupt is being processed to prevent a lost interrupt 
    --> 確保OS為低延遲
    --> 有時候中斷沒有反應是因為發生中斷時卡在某個service routine中，所以其它中斷會被disable

Storage-Device Hierarchy

- Storage systems organized in hierarchy
  - *Speed*, Cost, Volatility
  - 越上層速度越快，但容量較低
- Main memory - only large storage media that the CPU can access directly
  - RAM: Random Access Memory
- Secondary storage - extension of main memory that provides `large nonvolatile storage` capacity
  - Magnetic disk

    ![img27](./image/NTHU_OS/img27.PNG)

RAM: Random-Access Memory --> Access speed (訪問速度) 每次都保持一致

- DRAM(Dynamic RAM)：
  - Need only *one transistor*
  - Consume *less power*
  - Values must be periodically *refreshed*
  - Access Speed: *>= 30ns*
- SRAM(Static RAM)：
  - Need only *six transistor*
  - Consume *more power*
  - Access Speed: *10ns ~ 30ns*
  - Usage: *cache memory*

Disk Mechanism

- Speed of magnetic disk
  - $Transfer time = data size / transfer rate$
  - Positioning time = seek time(cylinder) + rotational latency(sector)  -->  random access time，訪問時間是隨機的，因為是由機構來完成的
