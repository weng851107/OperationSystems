<h3 id="1.1.1">Mainframe Systems</h3>

> Batch
> Multi-programming
> Time-sharing

One of the earliest computers

Evolution:

- Batch -> Multi-programming -> Time-sharing

Still exists in today's world

- For *critical application* with better **reliability** & **security**
- Bulk data processing
- Widely used in hospital, banks....

**Mainframe - Batch Systems**

- 透過一堆打洞的卡片程序，插入系統中來執行程式
- 一次只能執行一個程序
- Memory layout只分為 operating system 與 user program area

- Drawbacks:
  - *One job at a time*
  - *No interaction* between users and jobs
  - *CPU is often idle*
    - I/O speed << CPU speed (at least 1:1000)

- OS doesn't need to make any decision
